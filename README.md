### Hello!

My name is Neil Hendren, and I am a software engineer from Boulder, Colorado. I have a background in academic research and front-end web design, specifically designing interactive instructional simulations for [learncheme.com](https://www.learncheme.com). The [LearnChemE Github Pages](https://github.com/LearnChemE/LearnChemE.github.io) repository contains all of the embeddable simulations as well as some other features used on the website. I also designed [learncheme.com](https://www.learncheme.com) and all other features on the website, though most of my time was spent building [scientific simulations](https://learncheme.com/simulations/). I have also spent a considerable amount of time working with Mathematica, Matlab, and Python on scientific simulations.

I am currently attending [Turing School of Coding](https://turing.edu/backend) to learn back-end development using Ruby on Rails.

I love playing music, I have played classical piano since I was 9 years old and picked up guitar at 12, and drums and bass at 15. I also enjoy playing chess and am always up for a game!

I am currently looking for software engineering career opportunities; email me at neil.hendren@gmail.com
